# Instructions

To make it easier for jQuery users to understand the use of Vue, cdn's are used.

The project has 3 files

- [ ] index.html -> contains the other two files contained in iframe's to compare performance and results.

- [ ] jQuery.html -> jQuery proyect code

- [ ] Vue.html -> Vue proyect code

It has been used [purecss](https://unpkg.com/purecss@1.0.0/build/forms-min.css) for aesthetic purposes

## Conclusion and challenge

Although the example is simple, there are some important differences between the two systems: 

* Vue does not manipulate the DOM
* The code is simpler and clearer
* Event control is not necessary (in this case)
* Explains the use of v-model
